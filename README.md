### Project Specifications Document


---


**Project Title:** Legal Notices Publication System


**Project Overview:**
The Legal Notices Management System is designed to manage and visualize legal notices with robust features for authorization, logins, role management, and CRUD operations. The project will be developed using Flask and SQLite, incorporating Docker for containerization, and will follow a microservices architecture. It will be deployed using GitLab CI/CD to maintain environments for development, testing, QA, and production.


**Project Objectives:**
- Implement a scalable and maintainable system for managing legal notices.
- Ensure secure access and role management for different types of users.
- Facilitate collaboration among developers using GitLab and Docker.
- Provide environments for development, testing, QA, and production to ensure quality code.

### 1. Functional Requirements


#### 1.1 User Authentication and Authorization
- Users must be able to register and log in to the system.
- Different roles such as Admin, Editor, and Viewer must be defined.
- Role-based access control must be implemented to restrict access to certain features based on user roles.


#### 1.2 Legal Notices Management
- Users must be able to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) legal notices.
- Each legal notice must include fields such as Notice Name, Language, Province, Estate Number, Person Name, Person Address, Curator/Tutor Name, Curator/Tutor Address, First Names, Surname, Address, Appointor or Terminate List, From Date, Masters Office, Advertiser Name, Advertiser Address, Advertiser Email, and Date Submitted.


#### 1.3 Data Visualization
- Provide a web interface to visualize the legal notices in a tabular format.
- Implement functionality to delete a row from the table.

### 2. Non-Functional Requirements


#### 2.1 Performance
- The system should handle multiple simultaneous users without performance degradation.


#### 2.2 Security
- Sensitive data must be encrypted.
- Implement input validation to prevent SQL injection and other security vulnerabilities.


#### 2.3 Usability
- The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
- Provide clear error messages and feedback to users.


#### 2.4 Maintainability
- Code should be modular and well-documented.
- Use Docker to ensure consistency across different environments.


#### 2.5 Scalability
- The system architecture should allow for easy addition of new features and scaling up of resources.
